  Create a new class "UtensilCheck" that will provide information on what to include in a take-out order
  of a MenuItem
  
  The class will contain several static boolean methods, each of which take a MenuItem in as a parameter:
    -requireFork
    -requireKnife
    -requireSpoon
    -requireStraw
    
  You can look at the unit test to determine the correct return value for each item. Generally, all Sandwiches
  require both knife and fork; Salads require only a fork; Drinks require neither knife nor fork; a Drink usually
  requires a straw, unless it is a Cappuccino, in which case it requires a spoon but not a straw.
  
  Hint: You will need to determine the type of your parameter at run-time. You can do this using either the instanceof operator
  or the object's .class() method. You are free to use either, but be aware of the difference between them (i.e. look it up!)
