You have a class Question which can be used in a Quiz application. The design of this class is maybe a bit odd,
and the challenge is that you CANNOT change the Question class in any way.

Nonetheless, you are going to create a subclass of Question called TrueFalseQuestion.

The TrueFalseQuestion class needs to implement the following behaviour:

1. We want the "Answer True or False: " to be prepended automatically to the question text.
e.g. If the user sets the text of the Question to "Albert Einstein was the inventer of Java." the TrueFalseQuestion.getText will be displayed to the user like this

	Answer True or False: Albert Einstein was the inventer of Java.

2. Capitalization should not matter when determining if the answer is correct. 

3. 't' for true and 'f' for false should be accepted as response.

Note that some of the superclass methods are set to 'final, which means you cannot override them.
Hint: you will need to override those methods not set to final and thereby modify the behaviour of the superclass without replacing it.
